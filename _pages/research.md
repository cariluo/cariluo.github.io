## Bootstrap Embedding
![be_picture](images/research/bootstrap_pic.png)
Electron correlation is intrinsically local and this can be exploited by a variety of embedding methods. These embedding methods partition the system into small fragments that can each be manageably treated with high-accuracy theories, and use a cheaper theory for the interactions of the fragment with its surrounding bath. The largest errors lie at fragment edges where fragment-bath interactions are most strong. To overcome this, we have developed a fragment embedding scheme where the system is partitioned into overlapping fragments, each with an accurately described center and inaccurately described bath. We constrain the edge site of one fragment to match the same site on an overlapping fragment, where that site is in that fragmentâ€™s center. In this way, the calculation pulls itself up by its own bootstraps, giving this method the name Bootstrap Embedding.

Bootstrap Embedding has seen initial success in our group for lattice models and simple molecular systems. We have extended the success of Bootstrap Embedding to molecules where fragment centers can naturally be defined as atoms and the fragment edges as atoms bonded to the center. Current work in our group focuses on improving and applying Bootstrap Embedding in the context of real molecules in large basis sets.
